# SPARK GRIP DATA SCIENCE T1
 This task involves simple linear regression where the given data includes number of study hours of a student and their respective marks. i am using octave 5.2.0 for this problem since it is a very good programing platfrom for creating ML applications.
 i am using vectorization implementation here because it uses less computer resources and can perform iterations faster.
 
 ####RESULT####
 
according to my ML program for learning 9.25hrs/Day the student will get a mark of 92.934596!!


RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

1 - Download the code as a zip package
2 - extract it and open full.m in octave fro within the directory
3 - run full.m
4 - press continue (by pressing any key while on command window)
5 - view the results and plots :)
