# INTRO

This task involves simple linear regression where the given data includes the number of study hours of a student and their respective marks. I am using octave 5.2.0 for this problem since it is a very good programming platform for creating ML applications. I am using vectorization implementation here because it uses fewer computer resources and can perform iterations faster.

# RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

1. Download the code as a zip package
2. extract it and open full.m in octave fro within the directory 
3. run full.m 
4. press continue (by pressing any key while on command window) 
5. view the results and plots :)

## RESULT

according to my ML program for learning 9.25hrs/Day the student will get a mark of 92.934596!!
